Hello, 
Myself Sudhanshu Thakur,
This is my first machine learning project, it is based on classification.
The topic which I have selected is edibility of mushrooms bases on its properties(22 properties).
*********
The dataset was downloaded from kaggle.
It was already clean and did not have any null or garbage values, which made it easier for me to apply these 
algorithms.
********
I have applied KNN, Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and decision tree algorithms.
The accuracy has been measured by various parameters such as cross validation, confusion matrix, classification report,
ROC Curve and roc auc score.
The final accuracy was 100%.
*******

THANK YOU :)
